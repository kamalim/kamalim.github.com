This blog post about creating your own vagrant base boxes from an existing Virtual Box VM .Though the official vagrant site already speaks about creating linux base boxes, here are some basic steps and reqirement that will help you creating both windows and linux (ubuntu,centos) base boxes.
This blogpost will include the steps that I used to create a ubuntu and a windows 7 base box in one of my personal projects.


#### Linux (Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit) base box creation:

  1.Create new machine in Virtual Box.

  2.Keep the networking type as nat.

  3.Install Ubuntu 12.10 on it.The ISO can be found here http://www.ubuntu.com/download. 

  4.Create a user for vagrant.For ease of distribution keep the username/password as vagrant.

  5.Enable ssh_key_base authentication for the VM by copying your ssh public key to the vagrant users home directory .This can be done as below:

      $echo > id_rsa.pub /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys
	  $chmod â€“R 700 .ssh
	  $chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys

  6.Edit the sudoers file as below:

      $visudo
      ##comment out the line below:
      Defaults requiretty
     
      ## Add the below lines:
      $vagrant ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
      $vagrant ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL


  7.Install Virtual Box Guest Additions <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp12039536">http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp12039536</a>

  8.Once the above steps are complete proceed with packaging the box as below,

    $mkdir vagrant_repo
    $cd vagrant_repo
    $vagrant init ## This will create a Vagrantfile which will serve as the default vagrantfile.

    ##copy the id_rsa into the vagrant_repo directory

    $vagrant package --base <name of the virtual box vm> --output ubuntu.box --Vagrantfile Vagrantfile --include id_rsa

   9.This will create a vagrant base box ubuntu.box in the vagrant_repo directory.

   10.Add the Vagrant box to your project:

     $mkdir my_project
     $cd my_project
     $vagrant box add ubuntu ~/vagrant_repo/ubuntu.box
     $vagrant init

     ##Add the below lines in your Vagrantfile

     config.vm.define :vm1 do |vm1_config|
       vm1_config.vm.box = "ubuntu"

     $vagrant up

   Thus the ubuntu base box is created and added to a project.
